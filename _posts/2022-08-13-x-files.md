## Trivia

Some trivia items, the more complete list can be found on the [IMDB website](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/trivia/?ref_=tt_trv_trv).

* The famous echoing chord from the theme music was a fluke. Composer Mark Snow accidentally rested his elbow on his keyboard with the echo function on and he liked the resulting sound so much, he wrote the theme around it. 
* When Gillian Anderson got pregnant at the start of the first season, some network executives wanted her role re-cast. Executive producer Chris Carter adamantly refused their request.
*  In the early years of the series, Mulder is a firm believer in extraterrestrials and Scully is skeptical. In real life, this is the opposite, David Duchovny being the skeptic and Gillian Anderson the believer.
* Chris Carter wanted the show to end after the fifth season, when his original contract, as well as those of Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny expired. Carter wanted to continue the story in a series of feature films, starting with The X Files (1998). The FOX Network, however, found demand for the show too high to cancel the series, so they instead mandated the film to fit in between seasons five and six of the show. Carter found writing seasons five and six as well as the film very difficult, as he had to craft a screenplay that would not require the audience to have seen the show to understand it, and episodes of the series that would tie in to the film, but not rely directly on the film's plot to make sense. 
* Props from Mulder's X-Files office are currently preserved and on display at the Hollywood Entertainment Museum in Los Angeles. According to the museum, the famous I Want to Believe UFO poster from the office continually had to be replaced as copies kept disappearing from the set. The poster on display at the museum is reportedly one of the last available copies of the original set-used posters.
* During the opening titles, in the Mulder and Scully's FBI badges read "Federal Bureau of Justice, United States Department of Investigation." This alteration was necessary as making a fake FBI badge, even for a TV show, is illegal. The real badge says "Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Department of Justice."

### FAQs

The first movie Fight the Future takes place between The End (1998) and The Beginning (1998), i.e. between seasons 5 and 6. It is especially closely linked with the latter episode. The second movie, The X Files: I Want to Believe (2008), takes place between seasons 9 and 10.
